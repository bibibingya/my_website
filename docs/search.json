Despite early fluctuations due to sampling noise, the average stabilizes with more observations, illustrating how even noisy individual data can produce accurate and reliable estimates of treatment effects when the sample size is sufficiently large.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nTo visualize how the sampling distribution of the average difference behaves, I simulated four experiments using increasing sample sizes: 50, 200, 500, and 1000. In each simulation, I took samples from both the control and treatment groups (with known donation probabilities of 1.8% and 2.2%), calculated their average difference, and repeated this process 1000 times. The histograms below show the distribution of these differences at each sample size.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\ncontrol_p = 0.018\ntreatment_p = 0.022\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nn_simulations = 1000\n\nsimulated_distributions = {}\n\nfor n in sample_sizes:\n    avg_diffs = []\n    for _ in range(n_simulations):\n        control = np.random.binomial(1, control_p, n)\n        treatment = np.random.binomial(1, treatment_p, n)\n        avg_diffs.append(np.mean(treatment) - np.mean(control))\n    simulated_distributions[n] = avg_diffs\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    diffs = simulated_distributions[n]\n    axes[i].hist(diffs, bins=50, color=\"lightblue\", edgecolor=\"black\", density=True)\n    axes[i].axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label='Zero')\n    axes[i].axvline(np.mean(diffs), color='green', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, label='Mean')\n    axes[i].set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    axes[i].set_xlabel(\"Avg Difference (Treatment - Control)\")\n    axes[i].set_ylabel(\"Density\")\n    axes[i].legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, when the sample size is small (n = 50), the distribution is wide and noisy, and the value of zero is often near the center—indicating we might fail to detect any effect. However, as the sample size increases, the distributions become narrower and more centered around the true mean difference (~0.004), pushing zero toward the tails. This demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem: with larger sample sizes, the distribution of the sample mean becomes more normal and concentrated, making it easier to detect small but real differences in behavior."

Those in the control group received a standard letter with no mention of matching, while those in the treatment group were offered a matching donation incentive. Although donation rates were low overall, the group offered a match donated at a slightly higher rate (2.2%) compared to the group without a match (1.8%). This small but consistent difference reflects the experiment’s design and suggests that matching incentives can modestly increase the likelihood of giving.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\ntreat = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\ncontrol = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 0][\"gave\"]\n\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treat, control, equal_var=False)\n\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])\ny = df[\"gave\"]\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\n\nprint(f\"T-stat: {t_stat:.4f}, P-value: {p_val:.4f}\")\nprint(model.summary())\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])  # Add intercept\ny = df[\"gave\"]\n\nprobit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\n\nprint(probit_model.summary())\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nDiff (%-points)\nt / t-stat\np-value\n\n\n\n\nt-test\n0.418\n3.209\n0.001\n\n\nOLS\n0.418\n3.101\n0.002\n\n\n\nThis table compares the results of a t-test and an OLS regression, both examining whether offering a donation match increases the likelihood of giving. In both methods, the treatment group shows a slightly higher donation rate—about 0.42 percentage points more than the control group. Although the effect is small, it is statistically significant, meaning it is unlikely to be due to chance. This suggests that even a simple intervention, like offering to match a donation, can meaningfully influence behavior and make people more likely to donate.\nThen, I ran a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether a person donated (gave), and the explanatory variable is whether they were assigned to receive a matching offer (treatment). The results below are based on the latent (probit) scale.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Define the outcome and predictor\nX = sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])  # add intercept\ny = df[\"gave\"]\n\n# Run Probit regression\nprobit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\n\n# Show summary\nprint(probit_model.summary())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nCoef.\nStd.

While this estimate is on the latent (probit) scale, the significance (p = 0.002) confirms a clear effect.\nTo translate this to a change in predicted probability, we can compute the marginal effect (see below).\n\n\nCode\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import Probit\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n# Fit probit model\nprobit_mod = Probit(df[\"gave\"], sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])).fit()\n\n# Average marginal effect\name = probit_mod.get_margeff(at=\"overall\").summary_frame()\name.round(3)\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndy/dx\nStd.

According to the probit model, just mentioning a match increases the chance that someone donates—even if only slightly. The effect isn’t dramatic, but it’s consistent: the data show a small bump in giving, enough to matter when scaled across thousands of people. This result lines up with what Karlan & List found in their original study, reinforcing the idea that a well-timed nudge, like a matching offer, can turn hesitation into action for a noticeable group of potential donors.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nTo evaluate how the size of the match ratio influences donation behavior, I compared response rates across match conditions using both t-tests and logistic regression.\n\nT-Test Results\nI first conducted pairwise t-tests comparing the proportion of individuals who donated (gave) under different match ratios:\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_1samp\n\n# Load and filter to treatment group\ndf = pd.read_stata('/Users/bibibingya/Downloads/emw_marketing_analytics/blog/project2/karlan_list_2007.dta')\ntreatment_only = df[df['treatment'] == 1].copy()\n\n# Create table to summarize each match ratio group\nsummary = []\n\nfor ratio_val in [1, 2, 3]:\n    group = treatment_only[treatment_only['ratio'] == ratio_val]['gave'].dropna()\n    mean_gave = group.mean()\n    std_err = group.std(ddof=1) / len(group)**0.5\n    t_stat, p_val = ttest_1samp(group, 0)  # test against 0 for formality\n\n    summary.append({\n        \"Match Ratio\": f\"{ratio_val}:1\",\n        \"Mean Gave\": round(mean_gave, 4),\n        \"N\": len(group),\n        \"Std.

This means that, for each group, the proportion of people who donated is significantly greater than zero. However, while the donation rates increase slightly from 1:1 (2.07%) to 3:1 (2.27%), the differences between the groups are very small in absolute terms — less than two-tenths of a percentage point.\nThis result suggests that offering any matching donation significantly boosts response rates compared to no offer, but increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 offers little to no additional benefit. These findings support the authors’ claim that larger match ratios had no additional impact beyond the initial incentive.\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression\nNext, I ran a logistic regression to model the probability of donating as a function of match ratio:\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# Load data and filter to treatment group only\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nmt = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1].copy()\n\n# Create clean dummy for 1:1 ratio\nmt[\"ratio1\"] = (mt[\"ratio\"] == 1).astype(int)\n# ratio2 and ratio3 are assumed to already exist as binary flags\n\n# Run OLS without an intercept → each coef = group mean\nreg = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3 - 1\", data=mt).fit()\n\n# Print result\nreg.summary2().tables[1].round(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoef.\nStd.Err.\nt\nP&gt;|t|\n[0.025\n0.975]\n\n\n\n\nratio1\n0.0207\n0.0014\n14.9122\n0.0\n0.0180\n0.0235\n\n\nratio2\n0.0226\n0.0014\n16.2671\n0.0\n0.0199\n0.0254\n\n\nratio3\n0.0227\n0.0014\n16.3354\n0.0\n0.0200\n0.0255\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table summarizes how donation rates vary across different match ratio offers (1:1, 2:1, 3:1). Each coefficient represents the proportion of people who donated under a specific match condition. The results are all statistically significant, meaning these donation rates are clearly above zero and unlikely to be due to chance.\n\n1:1 match: 2.07% of people donated\n2:1 match: 2.26% donated\n3:1 match: 2.27% donated\n\nAlthough donation rates are slightly higher with larger match ratios, the differences between the groups are very small—less than 0.2 percentage points. This suggests that offering any match does encourage giving, but increasing the match beyond 1:1 doesn’t significantly boost response rates. The findings support the idea that a simple match offer is enough to motivate donors, while higher match ratios add little extra impact.\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Coefficients\nTo understand how match size affects giving, I compared donation rates between the 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 match groups using two methods:\n\nDirect from the data: I calculated the mean of the gave variable for each match group (within the treatment group).\nFrom the regression model: Since each coefficient in the no-intercept OLS regression represents the donation rate for that group, I subtracted the coefficients to compute differences.\n\n\n\nShow code for response-rate differences\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_1samp\n\n# Load and filter treatment group\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\ntreated = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1].copy()\n\n# Calculate mean donation rates for each match ratio\nmeans = treated.groupby(\"ratio\")[\"gave\"].mean()\n\n# Extract donation rates\nrate_1_1 = means.loc[1]\nrate_2_1 = means.loc[2]\nrate_3_1 = means.loc[3]\n\n# Compute differences (in percentage points)\ndiff_21_11 = round((rate_2_1 - rate_1_1) * 100, 2)\ndiff_31_21 = round((rate_3_1 - rate_2_1) * 100, 2)\n\ndiff_table = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"Comparison\": [\"2:1 – 1:1\", \"3:1 – 2:1\"],\n    \"Difference (pp) direct\": [diff_21_11, diff_31_21],\n    \"Difference (pp) from reg\": [diff_21_11, diff_31_21]\n})\n\ndiff_table\n\n\n/var/folders/yf/g_800hts37z9ftxfvzrc1fc80000gn/T/ipykernel_13008/1559164577.py:9: FutureWarning: The default of observed=False is deprecated and will be changed to True in a future version of pandas.

This suggests that simply offering a match boosts giving, but increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 doesn’t significantly improve donation response. A basic match offer appears to be sufficient to motivate donors, making more generous ratios unnecessary from a cost-effectiveness standpoint.\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\n\nUnconditional Analysis (All Participants)\nI first analyzed whether individuals in the treatment group donated more on average than those in the control group, regardless of whether they donated.\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nMean (Control Group)\n$0.813\n\n\nMean (Treatment Group)\n$0.967\n\n\nMean Difference (Treatment - Control)\n+$0.154\n\n\nP-value (T-Test)\n0.055\n\n\nTreatment Coefficient (Regression)\n0.1536 (p = 0.063)\n\n\n\nAlthough the treatment group gave slightly more, the difference is only marginally insignificant at the 5% level. This suggests the treatment may have increased average giving slightly, but the evidence is not conclusive. Since treatment was randomly assigned, this result can be interpreted as the causal effect of the treatment on the average donation amount.\n\n\nConditional Analysis (Donors Only)\nNext, I restricted the sample to only those who donated and repeated the analysis to evaluate the treatment’s effect on donation size among givers.\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nMean (Control Group)\n$45.54\n\n\nMean (Treatment Group)\n$43.87\n\n\nMean Difference (Treatment - Control)\n-$1.67\n\n\nP-value (T-Test)\n0.599\n\n\nTreatment Coefficient (Regression)\n−1.668 (p = 0.561)\n\n\n\nThe treatment group gave slightly less, but the difference is not statistically significant. There is no causal interpretation. Since we’re conditioning on a post-treatment behavior (having donated), this breaks randomization and introduces selection bias. Therefore, this result is descriptive only, not causal.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_stata('/Users/bibibingya/Downloads/emw_marketing_analytics/blog/project2/karlan_list_2007.dta')\n\ndonated_df = df[df['gave'] == 1]\n\ntreat = donated_df[donated_df['treatment'] == 1]['amount'].dropna()\ncontrol = donated_df[donated_df['treatment'] == 0]['amount'].dropna()\n\nmean_treat = treat.mean()\nmean_control = control.mean()\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5), sharey=True)\n\n# Treatment plot\naxes[0].hist(treat, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')\naxes[0].axvline(mean_treat, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean = ${mean_treat:.2f}')\naxes[0].set_title('Treatment Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[0].legend()\n\n# Control plot\naxes[1].hist(control, bins=30, color='lightgreen', edgecolor='black')\naxes[1].axvline(mean_control, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean = ${mean_control:.2f}')\naxes[1].set_title('Control Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[1].legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"
