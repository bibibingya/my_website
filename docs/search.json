These findings are consistent with Table 1 of the paper, where the means and standard deviations are visually similar across treatment and control conditions.\nThis reassures us that any observed differences in outcomes later on are unlikely to be driven by pre-existing differences, reinforcing the credibility of our causal claims.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nTo evaluate how the size of the match ratio influences donation behavior, I compared response rates across match conditions using both t-tests and logistic regression.\n\nT-Test Results\nI first conducted pairwise t-tests comparing the proportion of individuals who donated (gave) under different match ratios:\n\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_stata('/Users/bibibingya/Downloads/emw_marketing_analytics/blog/project2/karlan_list_2007.dta')\ntreated_df = df[df['treatment'] == 1]\n\ncomparisons = [\n    ('ratio', 'ratio2', '1:1 vs 2:1'),\n    ('ratio', 'ratio3', '1:1 vs 3:1'),\n    ('ratio2', 'ratio3', '2:1 vs 3:1')\n]\n\nt_test_results = []\n\nfor base_col, compare_col, label in comparisons:\n    group_base = treated_df[treated_df[base_col] == 1]['gave'].dropna()\n    group_compare = treated_df[treated_df[compare_col] == 1]['gave'].dropna()\n\n    t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(group_base, group_compare, equal_var=False)\n\n    t_test_results.append({\n        'Comparison': label,\n        'Mean (Group A)': round(group_base.mean(), 4),\n        'Mean (Group B)': round(group_compare.mean(), 4),\n        'T-statistic': round(t_stat, 4),\n        'P-value': round(p_val, 4)\n    })\n\nresults_df = pd.DataFrame(t_test_results)\nresults_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison\nMean (Group A)\nMean (Group B)\nT-statistic\nP-value\n\n\n\n\n0\n1:1 vs 2:1\n0.0207\n0.0226\n-0.9650\n0.3345\n\n\n1\n1:1 vs 3:1\n0.0207\n0.0227\n-1.0150\n0.3101\n\n\n2\n2:1 vs 3:1\n0.0226\n0.0227\n-0.0501\n0.9600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll p-values are greater than 0.05, indicating no statistically significant difference in response rates across the 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 match ratios.

The t-tests show no significant differences in actual donation rates, and the regression shows nearly identical odds of giving.\nTogether, both statistical tests and model-based estimates support the conclusion in the original paper: &gt; Increasing the match ratio beyond 2:1 does not meaningfully improve donor response.\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\n\nUnconditional Analysis (All Participants)\nI first analyzed whether individuals in the treatment group donated more on average than those in the control group, regardless of whether they donated.\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nMean (Control Group)\n$0.813\n\n\nMean (Treatment Group)\n$0.967\n\n\nMean Difference (Treatment - Control)\n+$0.154\n\n\nP-value (T-Test)\n0.055\n\n\nTreatment Coefficient (Regression)\n0.1536 (p = 0.063)\n\n\n\nAlthough the treatment group gave slightly more, the difference is only marginally insignificant at the 5% level. This suggests the treatment may have increased average giving slightly, but the evidence is not conclusive. Since treatment was randomly assigned, this result can be interpreted as the causal effect of the treatment on the average donation amount.\n\n\nConditional Analysis (Donors Only)\nNext, I restricted the sample to only those who donated and repeated the analysis to evaluate the treatment’s effect on donation size among givers.\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nMean (Control Group)\n$45.54\n\n\nMean (Treatment Group)\n$43.87\n\n\nMean Difference (Treatment - Control)\n-$1.67\n\n\nP-value (T-Test)\n0.599\n\n\nTreatment Coefficient (Regression)\n−1.668 (p = 0.561)\n\n\n\nThe treatment group gave slightly less, but the difference is not statistically significant. There is no causal interpretation. Since we’re conditioning on a post-treatment behavior (having donated), this breaks randomization and introduces selection bias. Therefore, this result is descriptive only, not causal.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_stata('/Users/bibibingya/Downloads/emw_marketing_analytics/blog/project2/karlan_list_2007.dta')\n\ndonated_df = df[df['gave'] == 1]\n\ntreat = donated_df[donated_df['treatment'] == 1]['amount'].dropna()\ncontrol = donated_df[donated_df['treatment'] == 0]['amount'].dropna()\n\nmean_treat = treat.mean()\nmean_control = control.mean()\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5), sharey=True)\n\n# Treatment plot\naxes[0].hist(treat, bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')\naxes[0].axvline(mean_treat, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean = ${mean_treat:.2f}')\naxes[0].set_title('Treatment Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[0].legend()\n\n# Control plot\naxes[1].hist(control, bins=30, color='lightgreen', edgecolor='black')\naxes[1].axvline(mean_control, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label=f'Mean = ${mean_control:.2f}')\naxes[1].set_title('Control Group (Donors Only)')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Donation Amount ($)')\naxes[1].legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nTo illustrate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN), I simulated donation behavior using binary outcomes based on the actual probabilities observed in the experiment:\n\nControl group: Bernoulli(p = 0.018)\nTreatment group: Bernoulli(p = 0.022)\n\nI drew:\n\n100,000 values from the control distribution\n10,000 values from the treatment distribution\n\nThen, I matched each of the 10,000 treatment draws with a randomly selected control draw and computed their difference. This resulted in a vector of 10,000 differences. The plot below shows the cumulative average of these differences across simulations:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\ncontrol_draws = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, 100000)\ntreatment_draws = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, 10000)\n\ncontrol_sample = np.random.choice(control_draws, size=10000, replace=False)\n\ndifferences = treatment_draws - control_sample\ncumulative_avg = np.cumsum(differences) / np.arange(1, len(differences) + 1)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg, color=\"blue\", linewidth=1)\nplt.axhline(y=0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Difference (0.022 - 0.018)')\nplt.title(\"Cumulative Average of Differences: Treatment vs. Control\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Simulations\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Cumulative Average Difference\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot clearly demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers in action, showing that as the number of samples increases, the cumulative average of the differences steadily converges toward the true population mean. Despite early fluctuations due to sampling noise, the average stabilizes with more observations, illustrating how even noisy individual data can produce accurate and reliable estimates of treatment effects when the sample size is sufficiently large.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\ncontrol_p = 0.018\ntreatment_p = 0.022\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nn_simulations = 1000\n\nsimulated_distributions = {}\n\nfor n in sample_sizes:\n    avg_diffs = []\n    for _ in range(n_simulations):\n        control = np.random.binomial(1, control_p, n)\n        treatment = np.random.binomial(1, treatment_p, n)\n        avg_diffs.append(np.mean(treatment) - np.mean(control))\n    simulated_distributions[n] = avg_diffs\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\naxes = axes.flatten()\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    diffs = simulated_distributions[n]\n    axes[i].hist(diffs, bins=50, color=\"lightblue\", edgecolor=\"black\", density=True)\n    axes[i].axvline(0, color='red', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label='Zero')\n    axes[i].axvline(np.mean(diffs), color='green', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, label='Mean')\n    axes[i].set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    axes[i].set_xlabel(\"Avg Difference (Treatment - Control)\")\n    axes[i].set_ylabel(\"Density\")\n    axes[i].legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"
